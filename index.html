              <em>HTML STRUCTURE</em>
            </b>
            </ul>
            <ul>
              <li>The Tree like structure of HTML comes from the fact that HTML elements can have other elements inside of them</li>
              <li>DOM- Document Object Model when programmers talk about the “DOM” they are talking about the tree like structure of a page.</li>
  </ul>

            <b>
              <em>BOXES AND INDENTATIONS</em>
              </b>
             <br>
            <ul>
              <li>Boxes, Boxes, Everywhere!!</li> 
              <li>Everything is in a box</li>
<li>The relationship between indented HTML and Boxes
As you read an HTML document as text, you see a wave of changing indentations going up and down the left side of the document the more indented an element is the more deeply nested its corresponding box is.</li>
  </ul>
  <br>
           <b>
             <em>TEXT EDITOR</em>
  </b>

<p>When writing code programmers use special text editors. These editors make the programmers life easier for example some text editors will automatically generate a closing HTML when you write an opening tag.</p>
